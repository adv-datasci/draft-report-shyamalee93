##Zillow Prize - Project for Advanced Data Science

The Zillow Prize Competition on Kaggle: The participants are expected to predict future sale prices of homes, to make the mean error on their already existing Zestimate even smaller. 
The submissions are evaluated on Mean absolute error defined as:

$logerror=log(Zestimate)âˆ’log(SalePrice)$

Our submission must have a log error at six different points in time for each unique property. 

## Project Plan

1. Start with looking at the dataset in R
2. Data files :
  + Properties.csv : Contains a list of all properties and 58 features for each properties
  + train_2016 : Contains the training dataset which has the parcelID (Unique house identifier), transaction date and mean log error between actual sale price and Zestimate
  + Submission file - Contains mean log error across six time periods for every individual parcel ID
3. Do some Exploratory Data Analysis on properties.csv 
  + Figure out the categorical and continuous variables
  + Plot the distributions of continuous variables
  + Check variables have over 75-80 percent missing values, check if they can be imputed or discard them
  + Check if more variables can be determined: Ratios etc. 
4. Check out the Datacamp module on Machine Learning, start building a basic algorithm
