Aim: 
- Reduce Mean Log Error of the Zestimate.

What do I have? 
- properties_2016.csv : Full list of real estate properties in 3 counties in California 
- train data : All the transactions before October 15, 2016, plus some of the transactions after October 15, 2016
- test data : Has rest of transactions between October 15 - December 31st, 2016

What should I predict? 
- Predict the log-error between Zillow's Zestimate and the actual sale price given all the features of a home. 
  [The log error is defined as  logerror=log(Zestimate)âˆ’log(SalePrice)]
 - Predict this at six different points in time
 
 What do I intend to do? 
 - Understand what they would like us to submit thoroughly
 - Start with looking at all 58 features of a house given in properties
 - There seems to be a lot of missing values - what do I do with those? 
 - Exploratory Data Analysis
      - Look at the training data set - make plots of transaction dates, values of log error by date, distribution of log error, parcelID's
      - Check which features have most missing values
